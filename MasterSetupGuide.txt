Master Setup Guide
==================

Last updated: ID canonicalization pass

- Stat and definition IDs are standardized to dot-separated notation.
- Canonical example format: core.maxHealth, combat.baseDamage, production.workSpeed.
- Legacy '-' and '_' IDs are treated as migration inputs only.
- Run validation from Unity menu: Tools/Validation/Validate Canonical Stat IDs.
