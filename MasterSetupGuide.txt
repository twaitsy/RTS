Master Setup Guide

Last updated: Strict canonical stat ID mode + migration-only compatibility mapping

Strict canonical stat ID mode (project-scoped editor setting):
- Toggle via Unity menu: `Tools/Validation/Strict Canonical Stat IDs`.
- Setting is stored per project/editor via `EditorPrefs`.
- Default is OFF for rollout safety.

Strict mode behavior:
- Validation no longer treats legacy compatibility IDs as acceptable references.
- Validation errors now include:
  - asset path,
  - serialized property path,
  - required canonical stat ID,
  - migration command to run.
- Compatibility mapping is reserved for migration command flows only.

Stat migration workflow (single supported command):
- Run Unity menu command: `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs`.
- This is the canonical migration entry point and executes all phases in order:
  1) legacy field lift,
  2) canonical statId rewrite,
  3) cleanup/removals.
- Migration output now logs per-phase counts so teams can verify parity and impact.

Rollout steps:
1) Run `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs` and commit migrated assets.
2) Run `Tools/Validation/Validate Canonical Stat IDs` with strict mode OFF to baseline remaining issues.
3) Enable `Tools/Validation/Strict Canonical Stat IDs`.
4) Re-run validation and fix remaining references exactly as reported (asset path + property path + required canonical ID).
5) Keep strict mode enabled in team workflow/CI once project is clean.

Deprecation note:
- The old `Tools/DataDrivenRTS/Migrate Legacy Stats To Canonical Entries` menu path is deprecated and removed after parity confirmation.
