Master Setup Guide
==================

Last updated: Safe definition ID migration allowlist + dry-run preview

- Definition ID migration is now allowlist-based, not suffix-based string matching.
- The migration tool updates only:
  - the selected asset's own `id` and `finalizedId`, and
  - known reference-field paths sourced from registry schema metadata plus explicit custom mappings.
- Guardrails skip Unity/internal engine fields and unrelated string IDs.
- Use dry-run preview in the migration window to inspect planned edits before applying.
- Open from Unity menu: Tools/Data/Definition ID Migration.
