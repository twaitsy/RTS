Master Setup Guide
==================

Last updated: Unified stat migration orchestration and single supported command

Stat migration workflow (single supported command):
- Run Unity menu command: `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs`.
- This is the canonical migration entry point and executes all phases in order:
  1) legacy field lift,
  2) canonical statId rewrite,
  3) cleanup/removals.
- Migration output now logs per-phase counts so teams can verify parity and impact.

Deprecation note:
- The old `Tools/DataDrivenRTS/Migrate Legacy Stats To Canonical Entries` menu path is deprecated and removed after parity confirmation.
