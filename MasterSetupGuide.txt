Master Setup Guide
==================

Last updated: CanonicalStatIds alias compatibility update

- Stat and definition IDs remain standardized to dot-separated notation in generated IDs.
- Canonical example format: core.maxhealth, combat.basedamage, production.workspeed.
- `CanonicalStatIds` now exposes compatibility aliases (for example `MaxHealth`, `BaseDamage`, `WorkSpeed`) that map to the generated lowercase-style constants.
- This preserves compatibility for existing callers while keeping the generator output deterministic.
- Legacy '-' and '_' IDs are still treated as migration inputs only.
- Run validation from Unity menu: Tools/Validation/Validate Canonical Stat IDs.
- Regenerate IDs from Unity menu: Tools/Validation/Regenerate CanonicalStatIds.
