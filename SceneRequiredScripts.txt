======================

Last updated: Task flow state model migrated to stay/advance/jump/terminate semantics

Task runtime scripts (required):
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Runtime/TaskStepResult.cs
  - Defines explicit step flow enum/state for `Stay`, `Advance`, `Jump`, and `Terminate`.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Runtime/TaskRunner.cs
  - Executes flow handling and index validation in `Tick()`.

Task step scripts (required and aligned):
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/QueryStep.cs
  - `Advance` on found target, `Terminate` on missing target.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/MoveToStep.cs
  - `Stay` while moving, `Advance` on arrival.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/WorkStep.cs
  - `Stay` while timer > 0, `Advance` when work completes.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/DeliverStep.cs
  - `Stay` while moving to drop-off range, `Advance` once delivery happens in range.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/LoopStep.cs
  - `JumpTo(0)` to restart task loop.

Validation stack scripts (still required for project definition checks):
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationReport.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationRunner.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.cs
- Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.Editor.cs
