Scene Required Scripts
======================

Last updated: Task flow result constructors renamed to explicit action names

Task runtime scripts (required):
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Runtime/TaskStepResult.cs
  - Defines explicit task flow actions via `StayOnStep()`, `AdvanceStep()`, `Jump(index)`, and `FailTask()`.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Runtime/TaskRunner.cs
  - Executes flow handling and index validation in `Tick()` using explicit `Flow` cases.

Task step scripts (required and aligned):
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/QueryStep.cs
  - `AdvanceStep()` on found target, `FailTask()` on missing target.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/MoveToStep.cs
  - `StayOnStep()` while moving, `AdvanceStep()` on arrival.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/WorkStep.cs
  - `StayOnStep()` while timer > 0, `AdvanceStep()` when work completes.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/DeliverStep.cs
  - `StayOnStep()` while moving to drop-off range, `AdvanceStep()` once delivery happens in range.
- Assets/Scripts/Tasks/Steps/LoopStep.cs
  - `Jump(0)` to restart task loop.

Validation stack scripts (still required for project definition checks):
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationReport.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationRunner.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.cs
- Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.Editor.cs
- Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationMenu.cs
