Scene Required Scripts
======================

Last updated: Unified validation orchestration and repair planning pipeline

Core validation scripts:
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationReport.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationRunner.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.cs
- Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.Editor.cs
- Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationMenu.cs

Editor validator contributors merged into unified report:
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatIdValidationMenu.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/ValidationAutoRepairEngine.cs

Authoritative validation command:
- `Tools/Validation/Validate All Definitions`
- Produces one consolidated `DefinitionValidationReport` for runtime/editor/CI.

CI command path:
- Execute method: `DefinitionValidationMenu.ValidateAllForCI`
- Uses same orchestrator core as runtime/editor command.

Repair commands (consume validator output):
- `Tools/Validation/Definitions/Validate only`
- `Tools/Validation/Definitions/Validate + apply safe fixes`
- `Tools/Validation/Definitions/Validate + preview fix script`
- Repair planning is derived from report issues (safe-fix plan codes), not from a separate field discovery pass.

Stat migration/strict mode scripts (still required):
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatFieldMigrationUtility.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/Validation/StatIdValidationSettings.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/StatIdCanonicalization.cs

Migration and strict mode commands:
- `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs`
- `Tools/Validation/Strict Canonical Stat IDs`

Assembly-safe bridge requirement:
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.cs`
  - Must invoke editor-only validators through reflected call to `DefinitionValidationEditorBridge` in `Assembly-CSharp-Editor` (guarded by `#if UNITY_EDITOR`).
- `Assets/Editor/Validation/DefinitionValidationOrchestrator.Editor.cs`
  - Defines `DefinitionValidationEditorBridge.Run(DefinitionValidationReport)` and owns editor-only validator list/order.
- This avoids partial-method cross-assembly compile errors (`CS0759`) while preserving unified validation output.
