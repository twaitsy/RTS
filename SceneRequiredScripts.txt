Scene Required Scripts
======================

Last updated: Strict canonical stat ID mode + migration-only compatibility mapping

Validation / migration scripts relevant to stat migration:
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatIdValidationMenu.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatFieldMigrationUtility.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/Validation/StatIdValidationSettings.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Validation/StatIdCanonicalization.cs

Single supported migration command:
- `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs`

Strict mode toggle:
- `Tools/Validation/Strict Canonical Stat IDs`
- Project-scoped editor setting used by validation code paths.

Migration phase behavior:
- Phase 1: legacy field lift into canonical stat entries/modifiers.
- Phase 2: canonical statId rewrite for serialized statId/targetStatId fields.
- Phase 3: cleanup/removals for empty stat references.
- Console output includes per-phase counts (fields/removals and assets touched).

Validation behavior notes:
- In strict mode, legacy IDs are validation errors (not accepted runtime/validation references).
- Validation errors include asset path + property path + required canonical ID.
- Compatibility map lookups are used by migration rewrite only.

Deprecated/removed command:
- `Tools/DataDrivenRTS/Migrate Legacy Stats To Canonical Entries`
