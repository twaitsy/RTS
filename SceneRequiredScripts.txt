Last updated: Unified stat migration orchestration and single supported command

Validation / migration scripts relevant to stat migration:
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatIdValidationMenu.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Editor/StatFieldMigrationUtility.cs

Single supported migration command:
- `Tools/Validation/Migrate Legacy Stat IDs`

Migration phase behavior:
- Phase 1: legacy field lift into canonical stat entries/modifiers.
- Phase 2: canonical statId rewrite for serialized statId/targetStatId fields.
- Phase 3: cleanup/removals for empty stat references.
- Console output includes per-phase counts (fields/removals and assets touched).

Deprecated/removed command:
- `Tools/DataDrivenRTS/Migrate Legacy Stats To Canonical Entries`
